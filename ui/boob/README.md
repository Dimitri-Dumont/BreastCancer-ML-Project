# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

To run the React + Vite app locally:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd BreastCancer-ML-Project/ui/boob
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`


## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally  
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues

## Tech Stack

- **React** ^19.1.0 - UI library
- **Vite** ^6.3.5 - Build tool and development server
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## Development

The app uses Vite's fast refresh feature, so changes will be reflected immediately in the browser during development.
